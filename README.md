This repository contains the work developed as part of a data science capstone project.

As with most data science projects, we begin by collecting as much relevant data as possible from a variety of sources. Once the raw data is gathered, we perform data wrangling to clean, structure, and prepare it for analysis.

With a processed dataset in hand, we move on to the exploratory phase. Through this stage, you'll strengthen your SQL skills by querying real-world datasets and uncovering initial insights.

We then apply basic statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to better understand the relationships between variables. To explore more granular patterns, we group the data based on categorical variables.

From there, we begin building predictive models â€” evaluating and refining them to enhance their performance and reveal deeper insights.

The final stage of the project is to develop a compelling presentation that communicates the story behind your analysis, conclusions, and key findings.
